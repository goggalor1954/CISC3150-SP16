what i need to do for question 1.

create a list(in a seprate file, maybe a header file.) of numbers that i can use to test a set number of number. or create a function that creates a list of numbers from input to create this list so i can test mutiple times.

try to rember how to write a program so that its not using stated namespace( or is that only for header files?)

i dont have to write a full program do i? i just need to write one function.

Question5

holy fuck polish notation. who the fuck would use this?

ok. first write something that will take input and stick the character in a simple stack.
then you need to recursivly write a fuctuion that will take the first element of a stack , throw it into another stack. untill you reach then end or rhe mutiplication symbol.
then you neen to perform the proiper operation and put them back into the stack.
then you need to recursivly add the at the proper place on the stack

end contition is wehn you are at a number and the next element is the last one/has no number nor math symbol.
probably best to store the numbers and characters as string, or creat a stack where each element has either a num or character value.
